textmind - mind map base on command interface and text mode totally

	Compare with modern mind map tools, I like traditional text mode management of documents, an individual preference.

	You know, there are lots of files in various type in your disk, and I'd like create a tool for programmers.

	It is textmind, you do not need extras of additional packages and etc. Draw your map on the goddamn black terminal.

	Textmind is a definitely important project, it helps programmer work comfortable on non-graphic environment.

	Any ideas are welcome.
